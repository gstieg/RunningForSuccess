**About**

	RunningForSuccess was made for a Portfolio Project at Holberton School [https://www.holbertonschool.com/]. This project was made in Unity
	and has some C# code in it as well. The story behind the creation of this game is related to life. In the way
	that in life you run into obstacles, have to face different things. This game is a small representation of that.
	Throughout the game, you see you have to avoid different obstacles including (spikes, and water) if you don't you 
	will have to start the game at the beginning. In each level, there are coins you can collect aka "money" to relate
	to the real world.
